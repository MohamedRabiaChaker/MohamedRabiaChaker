# Hello there! 👋 Welcome to my digital workspace.

I’m **Mohamed Rabii Chaker**, and you’ve stumbled onto my corner of GitHub where I get to combine my passions for data and software engineering. This is the place where code experiments, dummy projects, and some hands-on learning all come together.

### A Bit About Me 🚀

I wear a couple of hats in the tech space:

- **Data Engineer 🧠:** My strong suit is building data pipelines, with **Apache Airflow** as my main tool for reliable and repeatable workflows. I’ve crafted and managed ETL pipelines and small-scale ETL infrastructures built around Airflow.
  
- **Software Engineer 🛠️:** I've got experience in building in-house tools and frameworks, working with infrastructure as code (in smaller doses), and generally making tech a little easier for teams. I design and deploy solutions with **Python** as my core language, although **JavaScript** is always in my back pocket when needed.

- **Evolving Spark Enthusiast 🔥:** Currently learning **Scala** as my entry point into the world of **Apache Spark**. It's been a fun ride so far, and there’s a lot more to discover.

### Core Skills & Tools

| Skill               | Tools                                                 |

I’m a **🐧 Linux 🐧 enthusiast** with a passion for getting hands-on in the terminal and diving deep into systems architecture. You'll often find me piecing together ideas, whether through Infrastructure as Code or by designing workflows that just *make sense*.

### What's in My Repos?

In these repositories, you’ll find:

- **ETL Pipeline Examples:** Simulated ETL projects built to showcase workflow designs with Airflow.
- **Tooling Frameworks:** Samples of custom tools created to make day-to-day dev work more efficient.
- **Scala & Spark Demos:** Some personal learning projects as I get deeper into Spark and distributed data.
- **Things I thought looked cool:** I might do the 'Developper thing' where I start building something cool then halfway through it get distracted, so oops ? 

Each project is built to showcase what I know and simulate real-world applications. Feel free to explore!

### 👀 Open to Freelance and Project-Based Work

I’m currently exploring new project-based or part-time opportunities. I bring a blend of solid technical skills, a knack for collaborative problem-solving, and an eagerness to learn. So if you have a gig in mind or think we could build something great together, let’s connect!
